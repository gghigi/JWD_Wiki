### The Internet

-   Born in 1969 as ARPANET connecting government agencies and universities
-   The _Internet_ refers to the network of connected computing devices.
-   The _world wide web_ came about in 1989 and is a collection of interlinked websites and other web resources.
-   Web browsers came about in the 1990s
-   _jQuery_ was the first JS framework to fetch data without page refresh
-   _Frameworks_ enable user-generated content to effectively be created, stored, and displayed.

### CS concepts

-   What is programming? _Put simply, programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute._
    -   _Programming_ is the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine (like a computer).
    -   _Programming is the act of telling a computer what to do._
    -   An _algorithm_ is a sequence of steps that the computer follows to solve a problem.
    -   Algorithms have three main characteristics
        -   They are **sequential**.
            -   Algorithms are performed step by step from start to finish.
        -   They are **conditional**
            -   Algorithms perform certain steps based on conditions of the system.
        -   They are **generalizable**
            -   Algorithms are applicable to many different problems that are of a similar type.
    -
    -   _Coding_ is the process of transforming those ideas into a written language that a computer can understand.
-   _separation of concerns_ - problems or features are organized in a way that makes code easy to understand and maintain.
-   **Variables**
    -   allow us to store information
    -   allow us to quickly _reuse_ a value in our program.
    -   let us easily _change_ a value in our program.
-   **Data Types**
    -   _Data_ is a basic unit in programming.
    -   In computing, data is the pieces of information that we use to build programs, like the numbers in a calculation, or the text printed to a screen.
    -   _Data types_ are exactly what they sound like: different types of data. Data types tell us about the data, including how it can be stored and what types of operations we can perform.
    -   Categorizing information using _data types_ is a way for a computer to distinguish different types of input.
    -   _Primitives_ are the simplest data types and are shared across many programming languages. They include:
        -   _Numbers_ — values that allow us to do calculations and keep count.
        -   _Strings_ — a sequence of characters or symbols often used to denote text.
        -   _Booleans_ — logical values that represent the idea of true or false.
-   **Operators**
    -   Operators are different symbols that represent an _operation_, such as the plus sign (`+`) as a symbol for addition. Operations enable us to _process_ our data, to transform it into something else.
        -   Making calculations using _arithmetic_ operators.
        -   Comparing information using _comparison_ operators.
        -   Creating logical expressions using _logical_ (aka Boolean) operators.
        -   Logical operators include:
            -   _AND_ — both expressions evaluate to true, so the final result is true:
                -   `((4 > 1) AND (2 < 7))` is the same as `(TRUE AND TRUE)`. Evaluates to true.
            -   _OR_ — one of the expressions evalutes to true, so the final result is true:
                -   `((8 > 6) OR (3 > 6))` is the same as `(TRUE OR FALSE)`. Evaluates to true.
            -   _NOT_ — an expression, no matter its logical value, evaluates to the opposite:
                -   `NOT (1 < 3)` evaluates to `NOT (TRUE)`. Evaluates to false.
-   **Functions**
    -   A function is a named sequence of instructions, packaged as a unit, that performs a specific task when the function is called.
    -   inputs are _parameters_
    -   input values given when function is called are _arguments_
    -   When we _define_ a function, we specify the instructions, inputs, and name of the function.
    -   When we _call_ a function, all of its instructions are executed.
    -   Functions can be executed many times, making its instructions _reusable_.
    -   Functions can have _parameters_, which accept input values, making its instructions _flexible_.
    -   Functions organize a program into distinct units, making interchanging and editing them easier. This makes your entire program organized and _modular_.
-   **Control Flow**
    -   _Control flow_ is the order in which instructions are executed.
    -   _Control structures_ alter control flow in a program. You learned three structures, each suited for a different scenario:
        -   _Conditional:_ “if some condition is met, then do X. Otherwise, do Y”.
        -   _Loop:_ “do something Z number of times” or “do something repeatedly until some condition is met”.
        -   _Exception:_ “do steps A, B, C. If an error occurs, stop, and do steps J, K, L”.
-   **Lists**
    -   A _list_ is an ordered sequence of information
    -   You can access an item in a list by using its _index_ position
    -   You can _append_ items to the end of the list or _insert_ them in the middle
    -   You can also _remove_ an item from the end or middle of a list
-   **Loops**
    -   A _loop_ is a structure in programming where the instructions are written once, but a computer can execute them multiple times
    -   Each execution of those instructions is called an _iteration_
    -   _For_ loops (_count-controlled_ loops) repeat for a specified number of times
    -   _While_ loops (_condition-controlled_ loops) repeat until a condition changes
    -   _For each_ loops (_collection-controlled_ loops) repeat for each item in a collection
