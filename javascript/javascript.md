### Key concepts & Review (Codecademy)

-   Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with `console.log()`.
-   We can write single-line comments with `//` and multi-line comments between `/*` and `*/`.
-   There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.
-   Numbers are any number without quotes: `23.8879`
-   Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: `'Sample String'`
-   The built-in arithmetic operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.
-   Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a `.` after the name of the object, for example: `'Hello'.length`.
-   Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: `'hello'.toUpperCase()`.
-   We can access properties and methods by using the `.`, dot operator.
-   Built-in objects, including `Math`, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides.
