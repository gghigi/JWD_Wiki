1.  JS can be used in both front-end and back-end development.
2.  JS is standarized and frequently updated

    -   interactive audio and video
    -   maps and other features access the userâ€™s geographic location
    -   and much more!
5.  JS offers a wide range of frameworks and libraries to help create complex applications with low overhead.

-   Functions allow us to write a chunk of code once that can be reused over and over.
-   Events allow JavaScript to respond to user behaviors, like the user hovering their mouse over an HTML element or resizing their window.

server-side JS began in the early 2000s with Facebook and Google. It allows for scalability and can be integrated with other languages.
Node is one of the more popular versions of server-side JS. Used by Google Cloud and AWS

### Key concepts & review

-   Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with `console.log()`.
-   We can write single-line comments with `//` and multi-line comments between `/*` and `*/`.
-   There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.
-   Numbers are any number without quotes: `23.8879`
-   Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: `'Sample String'`
-   The built-in arithmetic operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.
-   Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a `.` after the name of the object, for example: `'Hello'.length`.
-   Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: `'hello'.toUpperCase()`.
-   We can access properties and methods by using the `.`, dot operator.
-   Built-in objects, including `Math`, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides.
