### Arrays Review (Codecademy)

-   Arrays are lists that store data in JavaScript
-   Always created with brackets `[]`
-   Each item in an array has an index (or numbered position), starting at 0
-   Items can be accessed using their index `MyArray[1]`
-   Items in the array can be changed using its index: `myArray[0] = 'new string'`
-   Arrays have a length property, which can be used to see how many items are in an array.
-   Arrays have their own methods, such as `.push()` and `.pop()`; `.push()` and `.pop()`
-   Some array methods are mutable (method will change the array) while others are immutable.
-   variables declared with `let` or `const` can contain arrays. Arrays are still mutable when declared with `const`
-   Arrays mutated inside a function will keep that change outside the function
-   Arrays can be nested
-   Elements in nested arrays are accessed using brackets and chain indices.
