## Git - a VCS (version control system)

-   Git is the industry-standard version control system for developers
-   Version control allows for safe collaboration of code
-   Git creates "snapshots" of the current state of the code base. It allwos you to time travel and go back to previous history. You can also rollabck to a specific spot in time.
-   a VCS allows you to create different versions of code and "travel" between different versions of the code. It also allows mutliple people to work on the same code without conflicts...or at least conflicts that aren't resolved before causing issues.
-   A "snapshot" of the code is called a `commit`. Code is added (`git add`) to the staging area from the working directory.
-   GitHub is a platform to use Git
    Use Git commands to help keep track of changes made to a project:

        -   `git init`  creates a new Git repository
        -   `git status`  inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
        -   `git add`  adds files from the working directory to the staging area and changes the file from untracked to tracked
        -   `git diff`  shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
        -   `git commit`  permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
        -   `git log`  shows a list of all previous commits

## GitHub - a place to use a VCS

-   GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It's a tool to allow collaboration on shared Git repos. There are other Git repo hosting services but GitHub is the industry standard
