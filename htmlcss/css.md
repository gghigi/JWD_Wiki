Review CSS Selectors

Throughout this lesson, you learned how to select HTML elements with CSS and apply styles to them. Let’s review what you learned:

-   CSS can change the look of HTML elements. In order to do this, CSS must select HTML elements, then apply styles to them.
-   CSS can select HTML elements by tag, class, or ID.
-   Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.
-   Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.
-   IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than tags. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles from a tag selector.
-   Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity, but can be necessary.
-   Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.
-   Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.

Great work this lesson. With this knowledge, you’ll be able to use CSS to change the look and feel of websites to make them look great.

### Box Model

Review

In this lesson, we covered the four properties of the box model: height and width, padding, borders, and margins. Understanding the box model is an important step towards learning more advanced HTML and CSS topics. Let’s take a minute to review what you learned.

1.  The box model comprises a set of properties used to create space around and between HTML elements.
2.  The height and width of a content area can be set in pixels or percentage.
3.  Borders surround the content area and padding of an element. The color, style, and thickness of a border can be set with CSS properties.
4.  Padding is the space between the content area and the border. It can be set in pixels or percent.
5.  Margin is the amount of spacing outside of an element’s border.
6.  Horizontal margins add, so the total space between the borders of adjacent elements is equal to the sum of the right margin of one element and the left margin of the adjacent element.
7.  Vertical margins collapse, so the space between vertically adjacent elements is equal to the larger margin.
8.  `margin: 0 auto` horizontally centers an element inside of its parent content area, if it has a width.
9.  The `overflow` property can be set to `display`, `hide`, or `scroll`, and dictates how HTML will render content that overflows its parent’s content area.
10. The `visibility` property can hide or show elements.
