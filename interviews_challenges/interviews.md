### Technical Interviews

**Key Points to remember:**

-   What are the main steps to approach a technical coding interview?
-   Ask questions to understand the problem
-   Process out loud to show to the interviewer what you are thinking
-   Walk the interviewer through your code
-   Add comments to your code
-   Check if the code is correct by looking for trouble spots
-   and what I’ve found (so far) is that they’ll give you a take home challenge but then in the f2f ask how you might expand on it
-   Steps to use to solve a challenge
    1.  Come up with a brute-force solution
    2.  Think of a simpler version of the problem
    3.  Think with simpler examples to try to notice a pattern
    4.  Use visualization
    5.  Test your solution on a few examples
-   Ask questions to understand the problem
-   Process out loud to show to the interviewer what you are thinking

> most efficient one. A mid or senior developer might need to worry
> about how fast it is.
